          For students, you need to check that the below criteria fits your case:
          You lived with your partner and they're eligible for universal credit
          You are responsible for a child, either as a single person or couple
          You have reached state pension age and live with a partner who is below state pension age
          Also on a side note, you can claim universal credit if you are 21 or under, studying any qualifications up to A level or equivalent and do not have parental support.
          You may be able to claim if you are studying part-time or doing a course for which no student loan or finance is available.
